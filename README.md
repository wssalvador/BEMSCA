# BEMSCA
BEMSCA - Bioprocess Economic Model for Stem Cell Applications

Stem Cell Engineering Research Group, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal

# Introduction
BEMSCA is a stochastic decision support tool for the optimal design of stem cell bioprocesses. It is capable of providing an optimized workflow and detailed economic evaluation of a user-designed bioprocess based on relevant inputs. For a more detailed explanation concerning the importance of bioprocess economic modeling, as well as the structure and potential applications of BEMSCA, please refer to the following research paper:

# Using BEMSCA
In order to use BEMSCA, a user must have a version of Python 3 installed on their computer. Ideally, the latest version should be used. If a user does not have Python 3 installed, they may download the latest version from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
